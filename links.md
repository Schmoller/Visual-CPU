# link properties

when dragging a line out from a port it needs to act like it does in draw.io 

after after connecting the link :

1. be selectable
2. be deleteable when selected
3. have handles when selected which allow you to move parts of the line

there should be handles on the quarter positions of each line segment. if1 of these handles are clicked its splits that line segment into 2 segments
which can then be dragged. this should operate like lucid charts does
